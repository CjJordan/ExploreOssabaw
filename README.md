# ExploreOssabaw
#developed by Matt Antonelli and Cj Jordan
An Android App developed for the Ossabaw Island Foundation to allow students on the island to create a digital journal and photo 
album while exploring the island's natural resources and historical sites. 

The map view identifies the location of each site. Clicking a location jumps to the journal entry associated with the site. 

The journal view provides a clickable list of journal entries.
